# GitLab Container Registry HTTP API V1

This document is the specification for the new GitLab Container Registry API.

This is not intended to replace the [Docker Registry HTTP API V2](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/), superseded by the [OCI Distribution Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md), which clients use to upload, download and delete images. That will continue to be maintained and available at `/v2/` (documented [here](../docs/spec/api.md)).

This new API intends to provide additional functionality not covered by the `/v2/` to support the development of new features tailored explicitly for GitLab the product. This API requires the new metadata database and will not be implemented for filesystem metadata.

Please note that this is not the [Container Registry API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html) of GitLab Rails. This is the API of the Container Registry application. Therefore, while most of the *functionality* described here is expected to surface in the former, parity between the two is not a requirement. Similarly, and although we adhere to the same design principles, the *form* of this API is dictated by the features and constraints of the Container Registry, not by those of GitLab Rails.

## Overview

### Versioning

The current `/v2/` and other `/vN/` prefixes are reserved for implementing the OCI Distribution Spec. Therefore, this API uses an independent `/gitlab/v1/` prefix for isolation and versioning purposes.

### Operations

A list of methods and URIs are covered in the table below:

| Method   | Path                                                    | Description                                                                                     |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/gitlab/v1/`                                           | Check that the registry implements this API specification.                                      |
| `GET`    | `/gitlab/v1/repositories/<path>/`                       | Obtain details about the repository identified by `path`.                                       |
| `PATCH`  | `/gitlab/v1/repositories/<path>/`                       | Rename a repository base `path` (i.e a GitLab project path) and all sub repositories under it.  |
| `GET`    | `/gitlab/v1/repositories/<path>/tags/list/`             | Obtain the list of tags for the repository identified by `path`.                                |
| `GET`    | `/gitlab/v1/repository-paths/<path>/repositories/list/` | Obtain the list of repositories under a base repository path identified by `path`.              |

By design, any feature that incurs additional processing time, such as query parameters that allow obtaining additional data, is opt-*in*.

### Authentication

The same authentication mechanism is shared by this and the `/v2/` API. Therefore, clients must obtain a JWT token from the GitLab API using the `/jwt/auth` endpoint.

Considering the above, and unless stated otherwise, all `HEAD` and `GET` requests require a token with `pull` permissions for the target repository(ies), `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests require  `push` permissions, and `DELETE` requests require `delete` permissions.

Please refer to the original [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/auth/) from Docker for more details about authentication.

### Strict Slash

We enforce a strict slash policy for all endpoints on this API. This means that all paths must end with a forward slash `/`. A `301 Moved Permanently` response will be issued to redirect the client if the request is sent without the trailing slash. The need to maintain the strict slash policy wil be reviewed on [gitlab-org/container-registry#562](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/562).

## Compliance check

Check if the registry implements the specification described in this document.

### Request

```shell
GET /gitlab/v1/
```

#### Example

```shell
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" "https://registry.gitlab.com/gitlab/v1/
```

### Response

#### Header

| Status Code        | Reason                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200 OK`           | The registry implements this API specification.                                                                  |
| `401 Unauthorized` | The client should take action based on the contents of the `WWW-Authenticate` header and try the endpoint again. |
| `404 Not Found`    | The registry implements this API specification, but it is unavailable because the metadata database is disabled. |

| `path`    | String | Yes      |         | The full path of the target repository. Equivalent to the `name` parameter in the `/v2/` API, described in the [OCI Distribution Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md). The same pattern validation applies.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `size`    | String | No       |         | If the deduplicated size of the repository should be calculated and included in the response.<br />May be set to `self` or `self_with_descendants`. If set to `self`, the returned value is the deduplicated size of the `path` repository. If set to `self_with_descendants`, the returned value is the deduplicated size of the target repository and any others within. An auth token with `pull` permissions for name `<path>/*` is required for the latter. |

| `size_precision` | The precision of `size_bytes`. Can be one of `default` or `untagged`. If `default`, the returned size is the sum of all _unique_ image layers _referenced_ by at least one tagged manifest, either directly or indirectly (through a tagged manifest list/index). If `untagged`, any unreferenced layers are also accounted for. The latter is used as fallback in case the former fails due to temporary performance issues (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/853). | String |                                     | Only present if the request query parameter `size` was set. |
| `created_at`     | The timestamp at which the repository was created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | String | ISO 8601 with millisecond precision |                                                             |

## List Repository Tags

Obtain detailed list of tags for a repository. This extends the [OCI Distribution Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#api) tag listing operation by providing additional
information about each tag and not just their name.

| `n`        | String | No       | 100     | Query parameter used as limit for pagination. Defaults to 100. Must be a positive integer between `1` and `1000` (inclusive). If the value is not a valid integer, the `INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER_TYPE` error is returned. If the value is a valid integer but is out of the rage then an `INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER_VALUE` error is returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `name`     | String | No       |         | Tag name filter. If set, tags are filtered using a partial match against its value. Does not support regular expressions. Only lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, underscores, periods, and hyphen characters are allowed. Maximum of 128 characters. It must respect the `[a-zA-Z0-9._-]{1,128}` pattern. If the value is not valid, the `INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER_VALUE` error is returned.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `sort`     | String | No       | "asc"   | Sort tags by name in ascending or descending order. Use either `"asc"` or `"desc"`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### Pagination

The response is marker-based paginated, using a marker (`last` or `before`, which are mutually exclusive) and limit (`n`) query parameters to paginate through tags.
The default page size is 100, and it can be optionally increased to a maximum of 1000.

In case more tags exist beyond those included in each response, the response `Link` header will contain the URL for the
next page or previous page (depending on if `last` or `before` was used), encoded as specified in [RFC5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). If the header is not present, the client can assume that all tags have been retrieved already.

As an example, consider a repository named `app` with six tags: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e` and `f`. To start retrieving the details
of these tags with a page size of `2`, the `n` query parameter should be set to `2`:

```text
?n=2
```

As result, the response will include the details of tags `a` and `b`, as they are lexicographically the first and second
tag in the repository. The `Link` header would then be filled and point to the second page:

```http
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Link: <https://registry.gitlab.com/gitlab/v1/repositories/app/tags/list/?n=2&last=b>; rel="next"
```

Note that `last` is set to `b`, as that was the last tag included in the first page. Invoking this URL will therefore
give us the second page with tags `c` and `d`. 

Requesting the tags list from the `Link` header will return the list of tags _and_ the `Link` header with the `next` and `previous`
URLs:

```http
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Link: <https://registry.gitlab.com/gitlab/v1/repositories/mygroup/myproject/tags/list/?n=2&before=c>; rel="previous", <https://registry.gitlab.com/gitlab/v1/repositories/mygroup/myproject/tags/list/?n=2&last=d>; rel="next"
```

Note that the `Link` header includes `before=c` with `rel=previous` and `last=d` with `rel=next` query parameters.
Requesting the last page `https://registry.gitlab.com/gitlab/v1/repositories/mygroup/myproject/tags/list/?n=2&last=d`
should reply with tags `e` and `f`. As there are no additional tags to receive, the response will not include
a `Link` header this time.


#### Examples

##### `last` marker

```shell
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" "https://registry.gitlab.com/gitlab/v1/repositories/gitlab-org/build/cng/gitlab-container-registry/tags/list/?n=20&last=0.0.1"
```

##### `before` marker

Similar to the `last` marker when this query parameter is used, the list of tags will contain up to `n` tags
from `before` the requested tag (exclusive).


```shell
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" "https://registry.gitlab.com/gitlab/v1/repositories/gitlab-org/build/cng/gitlab-container-registry/tags/list/?n=20&before=0.21.0"
```

Assuming there are 20 tags from `before=0.21.0` the response will include all 20 tags, for example ["0.1.0", "0.2.0",...,"0.20.0"].

#### Sorting

The endpoint can take a query parameter `sort` with either values `asc` (default) or `desc`.
Tags are returned in lexicographical order as specified by the `sort` query parameter.
If used in combination with the `before` or `last` query parameter, the tags are first filtered by these values
and then sorted in the requested order.

##### Sort examples with pagination

Given a list of tags `["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]`:

| n | before | last | sort | Expected Result                  |
|---|--------|------|------|----------------------------------|
|   |        |      | asc  | `["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]` |
|   |        |      | desc | `["f", "e", "d", "c", "b", "a"]` |
| 3 |        |      | asc  | `["a", "b", "c"]`                |
| 3 |        |      | desc | `["f", "e", "d"]`                |
|   | "c"    |      | asc  | `["a", "b"]`                     |
|   | "c"    |      | desc | `["f", "e", "d"]`                |
| 2 | "c"    |      | asc  | `["a", "b"]`                     |
| 2 | "d"    |      | desc | `["f", "e"]`                     |
|   |        | "c"  | asc  | `["d", "e", "f"]`                |
|   |        | "c"  | desc | `["b", "a"]`                     |
| 2 |        | "b"  | asc  | `["c", "d"]`                     |
| 2 |        | "e"  | desc | `["d", "c"]`                     |

## List Sub Repositories

Obtain a list of repositories (that have at least 1 tag) under a repository base path. If the supplied base path also corresponds to a repository with at least 1 tag it will also be returned.

### Request

```shell
GET /gitlab/v1/repository-paths/<path>/repositories/list/
```

| Attribute | Type   | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `path`    | String | Yes      |         | The full path of the target repository base path. Equivalent to the `name` parameter in the `/v2/` API, described in the [OCI Distribution Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md). The same pattern validation applies. |
| `last`    | String | No       |         | Query parameter used as marker for pagination. Set this to the path lexicographically after which (exclusive) you want the requested page to start. The value of this query parameter must be a valid path name. More precisely, it must respect the `[a-zA-Z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9._-]{0,127}` pattern as defined in the OCI Distribution spec [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#pulling-manifests). Otherwise, an `INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER_VALUE` error is returned. |
| `n`       | String | No       | 100     | Query parameter used as limit for pagination. Defaults to 100. Must be a positive integer between `1` and `1000` (inclusive). If the value is not a valid integer, the `INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER_TYPE` error is returned. If the value is a valid integer but is out of the rage then an `INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER_VALUE` error is returned. |

#### Pagination

The response is marker-based paginated, using marker (`last`) and limit (`n`) query parameters to paginate through repository paths.
The default page size is 100, and it can be optionally increased to a maximum of 1000.

In case more repository paths exist beyond those included in each response, the response `Link` header will contain the URL for the
next page, encoded as specified in [RFC5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). If the header is not present, the
client can assume that all tags have been retrieved already.

As an example, consider a repository named `app` with four sub repos: `app/a`, `app/b` and `app/c`. To start retrieving the list of
sub repositories with a page size of `2`, the `n` query parameter should be set to `2`:

```text
?n=2
```

As result, the response will include the repository paths of `app` and `app/a`, as they are lexicographically the first and second
repository (with at least 1 tag) in the path. The `Link` header would then be filled and point to the second page:

```http
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Link: <https://registry.gitlab.com/gitlab/v1/repository-paths/app/repositories/list/?n=2&last=app%2Fb>; rel="next"
```

Note that `last` is set to `app/a`, as that was the last path included in the first page. Invoking this URL will therefore
give us the second page with repositories `app/b` and `app/c`. As there are no additional repositories to receive, the response will not include
a `Link` header this time.

#### Example

```shell
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" "https://registry.gitlab.com/gitlab/v1/repository-paths/gitlab-org/build/cng/repositories/list/?n=2&last=cng/container-registry"
```

### Codes

The error codes encountered via this API are enumerated in the following table.

|Code|Message|Description|
|----|-------|-----------|
`INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER_VALUE` | `the value of a query parameter is invalid` | The value of a request query parameter is invalid. The error detail identifies the concerning parameter and the list of possible values.

## Rename Base Repository

Rename a repository's base path (i.e a path corresponding to a GitLab project path) and all sub repositories under it. 

For more information, see the in-depth [flow diagram `rename operation`](./rename-base-repository-request-flow.md).

### Request

```shell
PATCH /gitlab/v1/repositories/<path>/
```

| Attribute | Type   | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                             |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `path`    | String  | Yes      |         | This is the GitLab project path of the repository to be renamed (it is equivalent to the base repository of a project, if one exists). |
| `dry_run` | Boolean | No       | `false` | When set to `true` this option will only; validate that a rename is indeed possible and (if possible) will acquire a rename lease on the suggested `name` in the request body for a fixed amount of time (60 seconds) without blocking writes to the existing base repository path or executing the rename.<br>When set to `false` (default) this option will; acquire a rename lease on the suggested `name` in the request body, prevent further writes to the existing base repository path for the duration of the rename operation and execute the rename operation on the necessary repositories on the spot. |

#### Body

The request body is an object with the following attributes:

| Key          | Value                                                                   | Type   | Format                                                    | Condition                                                                                                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`       | The new name of the base repository (i.e. the new GitLab project name). | String |  `[a-z0-9]+([.-][a-z0-9]+)*(/[a-z0-9]+([.-][a-z0-9]+)*)` & `[a-z0-9]+(?:(?:(?:[._]|__|[-]*)[a-z0-9]+)+)?` | Must match the [GitLab project name formatting requirements](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/) as well as the registry [`v2` OCI distribution spec requirements for repository names](https://github.com/distribution/distribution/blob/main/docs/spec/api.md#overview). |

#### Authentication

The authentication token must have `full-access` to the base-repository (project-path) that is referenced in the request `path` parameter. 

For example, a rename request with `path` parameter `gitlab-org/build/cng` must have `pull` & `push` scopes on the project-path - `gitlab-org/build/cng` and `pull` scope on the project's sub-paths - `gitlab-org/build/cng/*`. 

The request authentication token must also contain access claims with the following attributes:

| Key | Description| Format | Condition | Example |
|-----|------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| `meta.project_path` | The path of the existing project to be renamed. | String | Must match the `path` parameter in the API request path. | `gitlab-org/build/cng` |

#### Example

```shell
curl  --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -X PATCH https://registry.gitlab.com/gitlab/v1/repositories/gitlab-org/build/cng/ \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d '{"name": "new-cng"}'  
```

## Errors

In case of an error, the response body payload (if any) follows the format defined in the
[OCI Distribution Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#error-codes), which is the
same format found on the [V2 API](../docs/spec/api.md#errors):

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "code": "<error identifier, see below>",
            "message": "<message describing condition>",
            "detail": "<unstructured>"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

### Codes

The error codes encountered via this API are enumerated in the following table. For consistency, whenever possible,
error codes described in the
